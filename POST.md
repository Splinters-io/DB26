# DB26: DataBouncing Toolkit

**Indirect data exfiltration via HTTP header injection through third-party infrastructure.**

DataBouncing concept by [John Carroll](https://thecontractor.io/data-bouncing/). First tooling by [Nick Dunn](https://github.com/N1ckDunn/DataBouncing). This is a complete Go reimplementation with significant performance and operational improvements.

## What is DataBouncing?

DataBouncing exploits how web servers process HTTP headers. When a server receives a request with a crafted `Host`, `X-Forwarded-For`, `Referer`, or other header containing a subdomain, many servers will resolve that subdomain via DNS — creating an indirect channel for data exfiltration.

The data never travels directly between sender and receiver. It bounces through legitimate third-party infrastructure.

```
Sender                    Third-party                 Receiver
  │                        domain                       │
  │  HTTP GET /            ┌─────────┐                  │
  ├───────────────────────▶│ Server  │                  │
  │  Host: data.oob.domain │processes│                  │
  │                        │ header  │                  │
  │                        └────┬────┘                  │
  │                             │ DNS lookup             │
  │                             ▼                        │
  │                     ┌──────────────┐                │
  │                     │  Interactsh  │────────────────▶│
  │                     │  (OOB DNS)   │  DNS callback   │
  │                     └──────────────┘  with data      │

## The Toolkit

### Recruiter — Candidate Discovery

Identifies which domains process which HTTP headers, creating a map of proven bounce points.

```

Features:
- 2000 concurrent goroutine workers

- Config file for persistent settings
- Structured JSONL output per run
- Real-time log parsing for callbacks

Output: `databouncing_candidates.jsonl`
```json
{"domain":"example.com","headers":{"host":3,"xff":1},"callbacks":4}
```

### Sender (db26-send) — Encrypted Data Transmission

Takes the recruiter's proven candidates and uses them to exfiltrate data.

```

### Receiver (db26-recv) — Collection and Reassembly

Reads the interactsh server log, deshuffles fields, reassembles the file.

## End-to-End Proof

```
$ diff original.txt received/file_e1ba.dat
$ echo $?
0
```

**Byte-for-byte identical.** The file was:
1. Encrypted (AES-256-GCM, Argon2id key)
2. Chunked (25 × 25 bytes)
3. Base32 encoded
4. Shuffled (random field order + decoy labels)
5. Bounced through 500 third-party domains via proven HTTP headers
6. Collected from 24 Cloudflare edge resolvers in London
7. Deshuffled, decoded, reassembled, decrypted
8. Checksum verified

No direct connection between sender and receiver. All traffic appeared as normal HTTP requests to legitimate domains.

## Anti-Detection

| Technique | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Random field order | No static wire format signature |
| Decoy labels | Defeats label-count analysis |
| Session-variable lengths | Different key = different field sizes |
| Multi-domain OOB | Traffic spread, no single domain sees all |
| Random jitter | No timing pattern |
| Random candidate | No domain pattern |
| Random header | Different position per request |
| AES-256-GCM | Payload indistinguishable from random |
| Random chunk order | Not sequential, no sequence pattern |
